## Introduction

Welcome to the Web Tools digital toolkit â€“ a powerful solution designed to simplify your online experience. This project is crafted with the aim of providing lightning-fast link shortening and seamless file hosting, making your digital interactions smoother and more efficient.

In an era where the digital realm is vast and ever-expanding, managing links and files can become a cumbersome task. This toolkit is here to change that. Whether you're looking to share concise links or host files effortlessly, this project offers a robust set of tools to streamline your online activities.

## Prerequisites

**Note:** Versions stated below are the ones used during development. Other versions may work as well, but they have not been tested.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `v20.10.0`
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) `v10.2.3`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JakubKorytko/web-tools
    ```

1. Enter the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd web-tools
    ```

### Client installation

1. Enter the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Server installation

1. Enter the server directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

**Note:** Both the client and the server apps need to be running for the project to work.

## Endpoints

### Client endpoints

- `GET /login` - login page
- `GET /link/:link` - redirect to the link from the database, params:
  - `link` - string, link to use
- `GET /file/:link` - get file from the database, params:
  - `link` - string, link to use

#### Client endpoints protected by authentication

These endpoints are protected by authentication. To access them, you need to log in first.
If you try to access them without logging in, you will be redirected to the login page.

- `GET /` - home page
- `GET /files` - file hosting page
- `GET /links` - link shortening page

### Server endpoints

The client app uses the server app for authentication and data storage.
There is no need to use the server app directly, but if you want to (or want to use the API for something else),
here are the available endpoints:

- `GET /get` - get table data, payload:
  - `table` - string, table name
- `GET /file/:link` - get file from the database, params:
  - `link` - string, link to use
- `GET /short/:link` - get link from the database, params:
  - `link` - string, link to use
- `POST /login` - login endpoint, payload:
  - `username` - string
  - `password` - string

#### Server authentication protected endpoints

These endpoints require a valid JWT token to work. The token should be passed in the `Authorization` header.

- `GET /` - temporary endpoint, returns a "WebTools API" message
- `POST /auth` - authentication endpoint, returns a username if the token is valid
- `POST /add` - add new link to the database, payload:
  - `src` - string, link to shorten
  - `link` - string, link to use
- `POST /addFile` - add new file to the database, payload (form-data):
  - `file` - file, file to upload
  - `link` - string, link to use
- `POST /del` - delete table data, payload:
  - `table` - string, table name
  - `id` - integer, row ID

## Production build

To build the app for production, run the following command **in the `client` directory**:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production build of the app in the `client/build` directory.

As for the server, remember to set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` before running the app.

## Tests

---

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">As for the `v0.1.0` version, the tests do not cover the majority of the code, and most of the existing tests do not pass due to changes in the project structure. This will be fixed in the `v0.1.1` or `v0.1.2` patch.
</span>

---

To run the tests, use the following command **in the `client` or `server` directory** (depending on which tests you want to run):

```bash
npm test
```

Or, run the following command **in the root directory**:

```bash
npm test --prefix app
```

Where `app` is the name of the directory containing the tests (either `client` or `server`)
